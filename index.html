        <p>
          Welcome to our wedding website! We are excited to announce our wedding
          in North Carolina, where Bryan grew up and we first met.

          We would love to have you join in our celebration of our marriage and
          will be sending out formal invitations by the beginning of March.

        <h2>The Big Day: Wedding Ceremony &amp; Reception</h2>
        <p>
          We're planning to hold the ceremony outside and the reception indoors.
          It should be temperate that time of year, but we'll let you know ahead
          of time so you can prep accordingly.
