        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Maiko and I met at the UNC Chapel Hill in August 2005. I had just come
          back from a one-year study abroad program in Japan, and Maiko had just
          arrived as a study abroad student from her university in Japan. We met
          at a pig-picking party welcoming international students. Although it
          was not love at first sight&mdash;we couldn't remember each other's
          names the next time we met&mdash;we drew closer as we learned more
          about each other. We began dating a month later and were inseparable
          throughout that year.

          After her study abroad program ended in May 2006, we completed our
          bachelors degrees in our respective universities, promising each
          other to move to California upon our graduation. I moved out to
          California first and found a job with Wachovia (now Wells Fargo) in
          Oakland; Maiko entered a masters program at the Monterey Institute of
          International Studies in Monterey to pursue a career as an
          interpreter. I drove two hours to see her every weekend, braving the
          early morning traffic on US-101 each Monday.

          After two years, she graduated moved back to Japan to work with Honda
          as an in-house interpreter. I was awarded a scholarship by the
          Japanese government to attend Tokyo University as a research student.
          Again, we commuted to see each other; this time the two hours was by
          train.

          Finally, after burnishing her credentials at Honda and toward the
          completion of my program, Maiko went freelance, we got engaged, and
          we moved into an apartment together. I've been working with BlackRock
          since summer 2012, and we've been enjoying our time together
          (finally!) as a couple since then. Our wedding ceremony in Japan was
          on October 8<sup>th</sup>, 2012, and we're looking forward to our
          ceremony in the US this coming April 27<sup>th</sup>!
