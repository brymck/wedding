        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Maiko and I met at the UNC Chapel Hill in August 2005. I had just come back from a one-year study abroad program in Japan, and Maiko had just arrived as a study abroad student from her university in Japan. We met at a pig-picking party welcoming international students. Although it was not love at first sight—we couldn’t remember each other’s names the next time we met—we drew closer as we learned more about each other. We began dating a month later and were inseparable throughout that year.</p>
        <p>After her study abroad program ended in May 2006, we completed our bachelors degrees in our respective universities, promising each other to move to California upon our graduation. I moved out to California first and found a job with Wachovia (currently Wells Fargo) in Oakland; Maiko entered a masters program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in Monterey to pursue a career as an interpreter.</p>
        <p>After two years, she moved back to Japan to work with Honda as an in-house interpreter. I was awarded a scholarship by the Japanese government, and I moved out to Japan to enter Tokyo University as a research student.</p>
        <p>In October 2011, Maiko went freelance, we got engaged, and we moved into an apartment together. I completed my program at Tokyo University in March 2012 and began working for BlackRock in June 2012. At that point, we finally decided that we were ready to get married.</p>
        <p>And here we are now.</p>
