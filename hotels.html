          We were able to get a deal with the Marriott in Charlotte near our
          house for $94 (one king) or $104 (two queens) per night. If you
          mention the McKelvey wedding, they will honor this rate until March
          28<sup>th</sup>. It's in a nice place with good amenities.

          Generally, we recommend staying near our house
          (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/Qyxwx">9427 Penshurst Trace, Charlotte, NC</a>).
          Hotels near the airport are few and distant from the venue. Hotels
          in the city are also a bit distant, although uptown is a nice area as
          well to spend down time.
